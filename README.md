 Ballistics is the field of mechanics concerned with the launching,<br> flight behaviour and impact effects of projectiles,<br> especially ranged weapon munitions such as bullets,<br> unguided bombs, rockets or the like;<br> the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.

  <p aligen="center">How to Use:<br>
Connect a servo motor to the Arduino on pin 9.<br>
Open the Serial Monitor and input values as :x y for x and ùë¶.<br>
The servo motor will adjust to the calculated angle.</p>

    <h4>Limitations</h4> 
<b>Air Resistance:</b>

<p>The program assumes an idealized case (no air resistance). In real-world scenarios, air drag can significantly affect the trajectory.</p>
<b>Input Constraints:</b>

Inputs must ensure that the height, initial speed, and range are physically valid. For example,<br> it‚Äôs impossible for a projectile to achieve a higher range with a slower speed unless there are other forces involved.
